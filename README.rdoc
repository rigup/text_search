= Intro

TextSearch was written to easily take advantage of PostgresSQL's full-text search capabilities with limited setup.
Inspiration was derived from [pg_search](http://github.com/Casecommons/pg_search/) and
["Postgres full-text search is Good Enough"](http://blog.lostpropertyhq.com/postgres-full-text-search-is-good-enough/) by [Lost Property](http://blog.lostpropertyhq.com/).

This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.
